# FoodRescue üçΩÔ∏è

FoodRescue is a modern, responsive web application built with React, designed to bridge the gap between food waste and hunger. It provides a real-time platform for restaurants and individuals to donate surplus food, which can then be claimed by NGOs and those in need.

This project was built to solve a critical disconnect: in our cities, perfectly good food is discarded as waste, while hunger remains a daily struggle for our neighbors. This platform acts as the digital bridge to solve this problem.
